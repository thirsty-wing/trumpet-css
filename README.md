# Trumpet CSS

Trumpet CSS is not yet DONE. It could change dramatically until it is DONE. Once it is DONE it will be indicated as such here and there shall be no more updates. Until then all proceeding statements that it is DONE in this document are void. DONE software is not abandoned software.

Trumpet CSS is a web UI component library that can help you build a UI in record time and is compatible with 100% of current web frameworks. It will also be compatible with 100% of all future web frameworks, even after Trumpet CSS is DONE.

Trumpet CSS is a single CSS file written in the style of [Reasonable System for CSS Stylesheet Structure (RSCSS)](https://rstacruz.github.io/rscss/), and is consumed by copying the file into your project and using it; a name for this pattern of software reuse is called "the vendor pattern". Users are then free to extend Trumpet CSS or eliminate portions of it as they see fit within their projects. The intent is that Trumpet CSS will never be included in a package manager for a few reasons:

1. Since Trumpet CSS is DONE, users never need to worry about a new version being released to which they must upgrade. Say hello to zero maintenance costs.
2. Not all web projects use the same language, nor package manager.
3. Less work for the author of Trumpet CSS. Again, zero maintenance costs.

## Trumpet CSS is amazing! How can I pay back this project for the good I have experienced?

A GitHub star goes a long way. Please consider starring this repository!
